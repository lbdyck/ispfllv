ISPFLLV - ISPF List/Log Viewer

This exec provides the ISPF user, who has allocated both ISPLIST and ISPLOG
to SYSOUT, with the ability to view the active contents of these DD's.

Why Allocate ISPLIST/ISPLOG to SYSOUT?
--------------------------------------

There are many reasons, the primary being the desire to prevent the
ISPLIST and ISPLOG datasets from being allocated to DASD where they have
to be managed.


Installation
------------

 1. Copy member ISPFLLV into a PDS in your SYSEXEC, or SYSPROC, allocation.

 2. Update your ISPF Command table with these entries:

          Verb  Trunc  Action
                       Description
          VLIST     3  SELECT CMD(%ISPFLLV &ZPARM LIST)
                       Display ISPLIST SYSOUT using SDSF REXX API
          VLOG      3  SELECT CMD(%ISPFLLV &ZPARM LOG)
                       Display ISPLOG SYSOUT using SDSF REXX API

 3. Update your TSO/ISPF Logon Procedure JCL so that both ISPLIST and ISPLOG
    are allocated to SYSOUT.

    //ISPLIST  DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(LRECL=121,BLKSIZE=1210,RECFM=FBA)
    //ISPLOG   DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(LRECL=125,BLKSIZE=129,DSORG=PS,RECFM=VA)

or

 4. Update your TSO/ISPF Logon Clist/Exec so that both ISPLIST and ISPLOG
    are allocated to SYSOUT thus:

    alloc f(isplist) sysout(h) hold lrecl(121) blksize(1210) recfm(f b a)
    alloc f(isplog)  sysout(h) hold lrecl(125) blksize(129) recfm(v a)

 5. Install STEMEDIT from CBTTape File 895 into a load library in your
    ISPLLIB set of allocated libraries, or into your Link list.

 6. Verify that the intended users have access to use the SDSF REXX API.
    If using (E)JES then validate that the SDSF REXX API equivalent has
    been configured.

Usage
-----

Once the above installation steps have been completed then just enter
VLIST (abbreviation of VLI) on the ISPF command line to view the contents
of the active ISPLIST DD, or VLOG (abbreviation VLO) to view the active
ISPLOG DD contents.

Optionally, enter VLOG ?, or VLIST ?, to display the ISPF Tutorial panel
for ISPFLLV.
